# CNN Image Classification Model (Tensorflow) 

The Jupyter notebook showcases the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Image Classification model. This model is designed to distinguish between two specific categories of images, such as happy and sad individuals. Additionally, the workflow includes a data pipeline aimed at enhancing efficiency and facilitating the integration of other image categories into the process.
